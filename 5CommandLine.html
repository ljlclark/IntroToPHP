    <h3 id="pageTitle">Running a PHP Program From the Command Line</h3>
    <p>
      PHP programs are usually intended to be run from a web request that comes
      to the web server. However, it is possible to run PHP programs directly
      from the command line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running a PHP program from the command line is useful for simplified
      editing and debugging. It is also useful for running local PHP utilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      To run a PHP program from the command line; open a command prompt and
      type: PHP PHPFile.php &gt; Output.html.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHP is the name of the PHP interpreter. PHPFile.php can be replaced with
      the actual name of the program file to be run.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output is sent to the output file named after the &gt; character.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to create command files for programs that are run frequently.
      This can be done with a text editor or with the following windows
      <a href="MoreCommandLine.html">Command Prompt</a> system
      command.<br />
      echo PHP PHPFile.php ^> Output.html > PHPFile.cmd
    </p>
    <p>
      Then type PHPFile.cmd or just PHPFile to run the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is helpful to name the file name part of the "cmd" file the same as the
      PHP program file to see that they go together.
