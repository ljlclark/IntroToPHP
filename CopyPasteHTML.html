    <p>
      These are the steps To copy and past text from an HTML page or most
      Windows editors.
    </p>
    <p><b>Copy</b></p>
    <p>
      On the HTML page, select the text to be copied by holding down the left
      mouse button over the beginning of the section to be copied and dragging
      the mouse to the end of the text to be copied. This will highlight the
      text to be copied.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most Windows editors the same thing can be done by moving the cursor
      to the beginning of the text, holding down the "Shift" key and using the
      Left, Right, Up and Down keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      On an HTML page, when the left mouse button is released, a popup menu
      icon will appear with three dots. Move the mouse pointer over the icon
      and the popup menu will appear. Select "Copy" from the menu. This will
      copy the text to the clipboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually in other editors, click the right mouse button to display the
      context menu and select "Copy".
    </p>
    <p><b>Paste</b></p>
    <p>

      where the text is to be inserted.
