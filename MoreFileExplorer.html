    <p>
      The Windows File Explorer displays the Folders and Files in the
      computer. The File Explorer allows the user to perform actions like
      creating and deleting folders and files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the File Explorer by clicking the right mouse button on the
      Windows Icon at the bottom left of the screen and selecting the
      "File Explorer" menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The File Explorer contains two lists. Each list is in its own window
      section. These sections are called Panes. Just like a window in a house
      can have several panes of glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the left pane is a list of folders. Select a folder by clicking on the
      folder icon with the left mouse button. The right pane will display the
      folders and files inside the selected folder.
