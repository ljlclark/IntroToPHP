    <p>
      The Windows File Explorer displays the Folders and Files in the
      computer. The File Explorer allows the user to perform actions like
      creating and deleting folders and files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the File Explorer by clicking the right mouse button on the
      Windows Icon at the bottom left of the screen and selecting the
      "File Explorer" menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The File Explorer contains two lists. Each list is in its own window
      section. These sections are called Panes. Just like a window in a house
      can have several panes of glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the left pane is a list of folders. Select a folder by clicking on the
      folder icon with the left mouse button. The right pane will display the
      folders and files inside the selected folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a Folder, click the right mouse button on an empty space
      in the right pane that is not highlighted. This will display a popup
      menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the "New" menu item. This will expand the menu. Select the
      "Folder" menu option. Type the name of the folder in the edit box
      provided for the new folder name.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a new File, display the popup menu as above and select the
      "Text Document" menu option. Type the name of the file in the edit box
      provided for the new file name.
    </p>
    <p>
      To change the name of a folder or file in the right window pane; click
      the left mouse button on the name text to display the edit box. The first
      click may only select the file name so click the text again to display the
      edit box and type the changes. Use the left and right keys to move the
      insert cursor. Use the "delete" key to delete characters.
